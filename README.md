# SIR Markov Chain Simulation

This project simulates disease spread using the SIR model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) as a Markov chain.

## Features
- Tracks population over time: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered
- Plots the progression of the disease
- Fully adjustable parameters (population, infection rate, recovery rate, days)
- Simple first-year-friendly Python implementation

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3
2. Install required libraries: `numpy` and `matplotlib`
3. Run the file `SIR_Simulation.py` or open `SIR_Markov.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook/Colab
